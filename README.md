Most ArgoCD MCP servers hardcode a few operations: list apps, sync, get status. When ArgoCD adds a new feature, you wait for the maintainer to add it.

**argocd-mcp** takes a different approach, inspired by [Cloudflare's MCP server](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp) which covers 2500+ endpoints with only 2 tools. It reads ArgoCD's OpenAPI spec at startup and exposes every endpoint through just 2 tools: `search` and `execute`. New ArgoCD version? Restart the server. Done.

- **103+ endpoints** from ArgoCD's OpenAPI spec, zero hardcoded handlers
- **Two tool modes**: `search` (2 meta-tools) or `generated` (1 typed tool per endpoint)
- Works with **Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor**, or any MCP client
- **No code per endpoint** — the OpenAPI spec is the source of truth
- **Two auth modes**: static token or OAuth via ArgoCD Dex (per-user RBAC)
- **Read-only mode** — disable all write operations with a single flag
- **Resource scoping** — restrict which ArgoCD resources are exposed with `ALLOWED_RESOURCES`
- **Rate limiting** — per-user token bucket to protect ArgoCD from excessive calls
- **Prompt templates** — pre-packaged workflows for common operations (unhealthy apps, diff, rollback, logs)
- **Audit logging** — structured JSON logs for every tool call (user, method, path, status, duration)
- **MCP annotations** — tools are annotated as read-only, destructive, or idempotent for proper client categorization
- **Optional semantic search** via Ollama embeddings

## How It Works

At startup, the server fetches ArgoCD's Swagger spec and parses every endpoint. Then it exposes them to LLMs via one of two modes:

### Search mode (default, `TOOL_MODE=search`)

Two meta-tools handle all 103+ endpoints. The LLM discovers endpoints by searching, then calls them via a generic executor.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ArgoCD /swagger.json] -->|Fetch at startup| B[Parse Swagger 2.0]
    B --> C[103+ Endpoints in memory]
    C --> D[search_operations]
    C --> E[execute_operation]
    D -->|LLM discovers endpoints| F[Returns method, path, summary, params]
    E -->|LLM calls API| G[Proxies to ArgoCD with user token]
```

### Generated mode (`TOOL_MODE=generated`)

One typed MCP tool per endpoint, generated dynamically at startup. The LLM calls `argocd_application_sync(name, revision)` directly — no search step, no path construction.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[ArgoCD /swagger.json] -->|Fetch at startup| B[Parse Swagger 2.0]
    B --> C[103+ Endpoints]
    C -->|Generate per endpoint| D[argocd_application_list]
    C --> E[argocd_application_sync]
    C --> F[argocd_cluster_get]
    C --> G[... 100+ more tools]
    D & E & F & G -->|Typed params, 1 call| H[Proxies to ArgoCD]
```

**Which mode to choose?**

| | Search | Generated |
|---|---|---|
| Tools registered | 2 | 103+ |
| LLM round-trips | 2 (search → execute) | 1 (direct call) |
| Parameter typing | Raw JSON strings | Typed individual params |
| Context usage | Low (~200 tokens) | Higher (mitigated by client deferred loading) |
| Best for | Lightweight clients, constrained context | Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor |

Clients like Claude Code and Claude Desktop support **deferred tool loading** — they only load tool definitions into context when needed, so the 103+ tools don't consume context window upfront.

---

## Quick Start

### Helm Chart (Kubernetes)

```bash
helm install argocd-mcp oci://ghcr.io/matthisholleville/charts/argocd-mcp \
  --set argocd.baseURL=https://argocd.example.com \
  --set argocd.token=your-token
```

See all configuration options in [`charts/argocd-mcp/values.yaml`](charts/argocd-mcp/values.yaml).

### Static Token (simple)

Best for local dev, CI/CD, or single-user setups. Uses a static ArgoCD API token.

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add argocd -s user -- \
  docker run --rm -i \
  -e ARGOCD_BASE_URL=https://argocd.example.com \
  -e ARGOCD_TOKEN=your-token \
  ghcr.io/matthisholleville/argocd-mcp:latest
```

#### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "argocd": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "ARGOCD_BASE_URL=https://argocd.example.com",
        "-e", "ARGOCD_TOKEN=your-token",
        "ghcr.io/matthisholleville/argocd-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### OAuth via ArgoCD Dex (per-user RBAC)

Best for multi-user, production setups. Each user authenticates with their own identity via ArgoCD's built-in Dex. **No static token needed** — the user's Dex `id_token` is forwarded to ArgoCD, which applies its RBAC policies per user.

**Step 1: Start the server**

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e ARGOCD_BASE_URL=https://argocd.example.com \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=http \
  -e AUTH_MODE=oauth \
  -e DEX_CLIENT_ID=argo-cd-cli \
  -e SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  ghcr.io/matthisholleville/argocd-mcp:latest
```

**Step 2: Connect your MCP client**

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --callback-port 9382 argocd http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to authenticate via the browser.

#### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop requires a publicly accessible URL (the OAuth redirect goes through `claude.ai`). Expose the server via a reverse proxy or ngrok, then set `SERVER_BASE_URL` accordingly.

Add the public URL as a remote MCP server in **Settings > Connectors** (e.g. `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`). Claude Desktop handles the OAuth flow automatically.

<details>
<summary><strong>Required: ArgoCD Dex configuration</strong></summary>

<br/>

The `argo-cd-cli` Dex client needs the callback URLs for your MCP clients registered as redirect URIs. Add a `staticClients` override in your ArgoCD `dex.config`:

```yaml
staticClients:
  - id: argo-cd-cli
    name: Argo CD CLI
    public: true
    redirectURIs:
      - http://localhost
      - http://localhost:8085/auth/callback
      - http://localhost:9382/callback
      - https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback
```

| Redirect URI | Used by |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost` | ArgoCD CLI (`argocd login --sso`) |
| `http://localhost:8085/auth/callback` | ArgoCD CLI (legacy) |
| `http://localhost:9382/callback` | Claude Code (`--callback-port 9382`) |
| `https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` | Claude Desktop |

ArgoCD auto-registers `argo-cd-cli` at startup and prepends it to the client list. Dex uses the last definition when there are duplicate IDs, so our override wins safely ([ref](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/util/dex/config.go)).

> **Note**: The `argo-cd-cli` client is public (no secret), so this override is safe — unlike overriding `argo-cd` which has an internal secret ([ref](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/19787)).

**How it works under the hood:**

- The MCP server acts as an OAuth proxy to ArgoCD's Dex
- Uses the `argo-cd-cli` public client (no secret needed)
- The Dex `id_token` (with `aud: argo-cd-cli`) is swapped into the `access_token` field and forwarded as Bearer to ArgoCD
- ArgoCD validates the token against Dex's JWKS and applies **per-user RBAC**
- Each user only sees the applications and resources they have access to

## Google Cloud IAP (optional)

If your ArgoCD instance sits behind [Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap), every request from the MCP server to ArgoCD is intercepted by IAP and rejected with `401 Invalid IAP credentials: empty token` unless it carries a Google-signed OIDC token. This is separate from the ArgoCD/Dex auth — IAP guards the network edge, ArgoCD guards the API.

Set `IAP_AUDIENCE` to enable IAP support. The server then signs **every** server-to-server call (spec fetch, Dex token exchange in OAuth mode, and all ArgoCD API calls) with a Google OIDC token in the `Proxy-Authorization` header. IAP validates and strips that header, and forwards the `Authorization` header (your ArgoCD token or Dex id_token) to ArgoCD untouched.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e ARGOCD_BASE_URL=https://argocd.example.com \
  -e ARGOCD_TOKEN=xxx \
  -e IAP_AUDIENCE=1234567890-abc.apps.googleusercontent.com \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/creds/sa.json \
  -v /path/to/sa.json:/creds/sa.json:ro \
  ...
```

- **`IAP_AUDIENCE`** — the value IAP expects in the token's `aud` claim. Usually the IAP OAuth 2.0 client ID (ends in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`), or the IAP-secured resource URL, depending on your IAP configuration.
- **Credentials** — resolved via [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials): a service-account key (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`), GKE workload identity, or the GCE metadata server. The service account needs the **IAP-secured Web App User** role on the resource.
- Works with both `AUTH_MODE=token` and `AUTH_MODE=oauth`. Leave `IAP_AUDIENCE` unset to disable (default).

---

## Semantic Search (optional)

Enable Ollama-powered vector search for better results on natural language queries:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d  # Starts Ollama + argocd-mcp with embeddings
```

Set `EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=true`, `OLLAMA_URL`, and `EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` (defaults to `nomic-embed-text`).

---

## Read-Only Mode (optional)

Set `DISABLE_WRITE=true` to prevent any disruptive action on your cluster. When enabled:

- **Write endpoints are hidden** — `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` operations are filtered out from the search index, so the LLM never discovers them.
- **Write execution is blocked** — even if a caller manually crafts an `execute_operation` request with a write method, it is rejected.
- **Read operations work normally** — `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS` are unaffected.

This is ideal for production environments, demos, or any setup where you want LLMs to observe but never modify your ArgoCD resources.

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add argocd -s user -- \
  docker run --rm -i \
  -e ARGOCD_BASE_URL=https://argocd.example.com \
  -e ARGOCD_TOKEN=your-token \
  -e DISABLE_WRITE=true \
  ghcr.io/matthisholleville/argocd-mcp:latest
```

---

## Resource Scoping (optional)

Set `ALLOWED_RESOURCES` to restrict which ArgoCD resource types the LLM can discover and call. This filters both search results **and** blocks execution of out-of-scope endpoints.

```bash
# Only expose application and version endpoints
ALLOWED_RESOURCES=ApplicationService,VersionService
```

Composes with `DISABLE_WRITE`:

```bash
# Read-only access to applications only
DISABLE_WRITE=true
ALLOWED_RESOURCES=ApplicationService
```

Available resource tags (from ArgoCD's OpenAPI spec):

| Tag | Endpoints |
|-----|-----------|
| `AccountService` | 6 |
| `ApplicationService` | 31 |
| `ApplicationSetService` | 6 |
| `CertificateService` | 3 |
| `ClusterService` | 7 |
| `GPGKeyService` | 4 |
| `NotificationService` | 3 |
| `ProjectService` | 12 |
| `RepoCredsService` | 8 |
| `RepositoryService` | 17 |
| `SessionService` | 3 |
| `SettingsService` | 2 |
| `VersionService` | 1 |

Matching is case-insensitive (`applicationservice` works).

---

## Generated Tools Mode (optional)

Set `TOOL_MODE=generated` to create one MCP tool per ArgoCD endpoint at startup. Instead of searching then executing, the LLM calls typed tools directly:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add argocd -s user -- \
  docker run --rm -i \
  -e ARGOCD_BASE_URL=https://argocd.example.com \
  -e ARGOCD_TOKEN=your-token \
  -e TOOL_MODE=generated \
  ghcr.io/matthisholleville/argocd-mcp:latest
```

<details>
<summary><strong>How generated tools work</strong></summary>

<br/>

Each endpoint's `operationId` is converted to a snake_case tool name with `argocd_` prefix:

| operationId | Tool name |
|---|---|
| `ApplicationService_Sync` | `argocd_application_sync` |
| `ClusterService_Get` | `argocd_cluster_get` |
| `ApplicationSetService_List` | `argocd_application_set_list` |

Parameters are typed individually — no raw JSON needed for common cases:

```
argocd_application_sync(
  name:      "frontend"      ← path param (required)
  revision:  "HEAD"          ← body param, flattened
  dryRun:    true            ← body param, flattened
  strategy:  '{"apply":{}}'  ← nested object stays JSON string
)
```

Tools are annotated with MCP hints (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) so clients like Claude Desktop categorize them correctly (read vs write/delete).

`DISABLE_WRITE` and `ALLOWED_RESOURCES` are enforced at startup — forbidden tools are simply not generated. The LLM cannot even see them.

</details>

---

## Application Diff (`diff_application`)

Both tool modes also register `diff_application`: what syncing an Application to a git revision would change, like `argocd app diff APP --revision REV`. It uses Argo CD's own diff library with the caller's credentials. Keep the `argo-cd` version in `go.mod` in step with your Argo CD servers.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `app` (required) | Application name |
| `revision` (required) | Branch, tag, or commit SHA |
| `app_namespace` | Application namespace, if not the controller's |
| `mode` | `live` (default): what a sync would change, drift included. `pr`: only what the revision changes |
| `format` | `diff` (default) or `json` with per-field changes |
| `stat` | Changed resources only, no diff bodies |

----------|-------------|
| `app` (required) | Application name |
| `revision` (required) | Branch, tag, or commit SHA in the app's source repo |
| `app_namespace` | Application namespace, if apps live outside the controller namespace |
| `mode` | `live` (default): live vs. predicted state, drift included, like the CLI. `pr`: only what the revision changes relative to the current target; drifted resources are listed, with their drift left out, but the revision's changes to them still show |
| `format` | `diff` (default): unified diff per resource. `json`: structured result with per-field changes as JSON Pointer paths |
| `stat` | Summary only, without diff bodies |
| `context` | Context lines per hunk (default 3) |

Each result starts with the sync policy (`automated`, `prune`, `selfHeal`), plus a note when removed resources would be left orphaned because prune is off. The tool is read-only, and it honors `ALLOWED_RESOURCES`, rate limiting, and audit logging.

The diff comes from the `github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v3` library, whose version is pinned in `go.mod`. Keep it in step with the Argo CD servers you connect to, so results match their CLI.

---

## Rate Limiting (optional)

Protect ArgoCD from excessive API calls by setting `RATE_LIMIT`. `execute_operation` and `diff_application` are rate limited — search is local and not affected.

```bash
RATE_LIMIT=10              # 10 requests/sec per user
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=20        # allow short bursts up to 20
```

<details>
<summary><strong>How rate limiting works</strong></summary>

<br/>

Rate limiting uses a **token bucket per user**. Each user gets a bucket that refills at `RATE_LIMIT` tokens per second, with a maximum of `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` tokens. When the bucket is empty, requests are rejected until tokens refill.

| Auth mode | Bucket key | Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **OAuth** | User email from JWT | Each user has an independent limit |
| **Static token** | Shared `"static-token"` key | All clients share one bucket |

> **Note**: In static token mode, an aggressive LLM can starve other clients. Prefer OAuth mode in multi-user production setups.

When a request is rate limited:
- The call **never reaches ArgoCD** — rejected before the proxy
- An audit log entry is emitted with `blocked: true`
- The LLM receives a clear error: `"rate limit exceeded: too many requests, please slow down"`

If `RATE_LIMIT_BURST` is not set, it defaults to the `RATE_LIMIT` value. Set `RATE_LIMIT=0` (or omit it) to disable rate limiting entirely.

</details>

---

## Prompt Templates

Pre-packaged workflows for common ArgoCD operations. MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) show these as selectable prompts in their UI.

| Prompt | Description | Arguments |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `unhealthy-apps` | Find all apps with degraded health or out-of-sync status | — |
| `sync-status` | Dashboard-style overview of all apps | — |
| `app-diff` | Show what would change on sync | `appName` (required) |
| `rollback` | Show history and rollback to a previous revision | `appName` (required) |
| `app-logs` | Fetch and analyze container logs | `appName` (required), `container` (optional) |

Each prompt guides the LLM through a step-by-step workflow using `search_operations` and `execute_operation`. No additional tools are needed.

---

## Audit Logging

Audit logging is **enabled by default**. Every `search_operations` and `execute_operation` call emits a structured JSON log entry to stderr:

```json
{"time":"2026-03-22T10:00:00Z","level":"INFO","msg":"audit","tool":"execute_operation","method":"GET","path":"/api/v1/applications","blocked":false,"duration_ms":142,"status_code":200,"user":"alice@example.com"}
```

Each entry includes:
- **tool** — `search_operations`, `execute_operation`, or `diff_application`
- **user** — email from the OAuth token (empty in static token mode)
- **method / path** — the ArgoCD API call (execute) or **query** (search)
- **status_code** — upstream HTTP response code
- **blocked** — `true` if the call was rejected by `DISABLE_WRITE` or `ALLOWED_RESOURCES`
- **duration_ms** — round-trip time in milliseconds
- **error** — error message (logged at ERROR level when present)

Set `AUDIT_LOG=false` to disable.

---
